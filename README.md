# 👨‍💻 My First Project

This project is a simple to-do list. It is built with a simple idea of you really don't have too much to-do.

The main idea is to prioritize the 5 most important thing you MUST finish today and pass the rest on to tomorrow or whenever you are free. There are 2 weekly goals that you can keep track of, but having your day cut into what's most important and what's not has really helped me and I hope can help others also.


## The front-end 

The front end is using react 18 with a couple of libraries added on (see package-lock.json).

## The back-end

Currently, is using node and express yet to be started on.
